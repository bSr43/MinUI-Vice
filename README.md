# Commodore computers emulator for MinUI / NextUI

This release if the for TrimUI Brick.
It hasn't been tested on anything else.

Just extract the content of the ZIP file at the root of your SD card.
Once done, add your games to the Roms folder, using the *VICE* tag.
You can bring up the keyboard by pressing *start*.

_Note_: the system is running at 50 fps (PAL). At the moment, NextUI is not able to deal with that. I've sent a PR which aims at supporting PAL systems, and I'm currently waiting for the proposal to be accepted. In the meantime, you may have to compile the PR by yourself...
